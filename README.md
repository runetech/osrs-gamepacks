# OldSchool RuneScape Gamepacks

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/runetech/osrs-gamepacks/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=schedule)](https://github.com/runetech/osrs-gamepacks/actions)

Collection of **unmodified** OldSchool RuneScape gamepacks. New gamepacks are automatically retrieved every 
30 minutes, due to Jagex always doing a 30 minute system update timer before releasing new revisions.

All of the collected gamepacks are located in the [gamepacks](gamepacks/) folder.

The tool for downloading, naming, and patching the gamepacks is the [osrs-gamepack-downloader](https://github.com/runetech/osrs-gamepack-downloader).
